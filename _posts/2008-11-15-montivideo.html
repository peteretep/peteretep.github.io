At the moment we are in Motivideo, the capital of Uruguay. We were expecting great things after Colonia, but it's a bit disappointing. It's a little dingy, dusty and really really dead. We're here on a Saturday and it was very quiet today. We went to an indoor market kind of place that specialises in Bar-B-Ques. It sounded great and looked great, and since we hadn't had any breakfast we decided to go for the full works; a full platter of meat of questionable origin for two. Chops, chicken, sausages, black puddings, spicy sausages, and a few other wobbly things. We won't be doing that again..

The meat sweats

After Montivideo, we have no idea where we are going. The plan was to go up to the Igcuazu waterfalls, but there is no obvious bus route up. The capital isn't that nice so we are keen to move on soon, possibly east, out to one of the beachy places for a few days.

One positive thing is that the weather has cooled down a bit, It was blowing a gale and spitting rain here today and we were actually cold! It was a nice change and a reminder not to throw out all those hoodies and jackets that are taking up so much precious bag space.
