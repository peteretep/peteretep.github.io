I recently started using a new note taking app called [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.info/).

Generally I try to avoid using proprietary software but this feels very different.
It's written by one guy, a chap in Japan called Takuya Matsuyama, and he's trying to make a living off developing it.

It's clearly written by a developer, for developers. The notes are written in Markdown and there is a really simple, clean interface. It syncs well between my computers and phone, and I find myself writing pretty much everything in it at the moment. I've even written this blog post with it.

I'm still working through a 60 day trial but pretty sure I'll be signing up as a customer.
