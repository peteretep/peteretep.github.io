Like <del>most</del> all developers, I am a heavy user of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>. There is nearly always someone who has had the same problem as you in the past and nearly always a helpful answer below it.

I was delighted to be able to add my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7148604/extract-list-of-file-names-in-a-zip-archive-when-unzip-l/13378583#13378583">first answer</a> to a question on stackoverflow and give something small back to the community - I've even got five "upvotes" so far!
