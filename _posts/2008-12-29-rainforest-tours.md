<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Hellooooo. Apologies for lack of blogging but we've been busy beavers! We're also a camera down. I misplaced it after the mountain biking trip. We were brought to an animal sancutary for dinner and  were warned the monkies liked to rob shiny things so I think a little family of monkies are playing with my camera as I type! A fine Christmas present no doubt. Anyway hurray for travel insurance, I'll purchse a new one soon.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">After the scariest bike ride ever we spent two days in Coroico. We then hopped on a bus to Rurrenabaque. The trip was yuck, worst one so far so hoping they wont get any worse. Once in Rurre we headed into the Amazon Rainforrest for a few days.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Unfortunately Peter was a bit sick for the experience but it was  nice spot for recovering too! We had  really great guide who had brilliant sound effects to encourage the animals to come out of hiding. He was a wee bit like the cop on Police Academy![gallery]
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">After the jungle we splurged big time and got a plane back to La Paz. Such a luxury for only fifty bucks! Getting out to the airport was quite the challenge. There wasn't enough space on the mini bus so we had to hop onto the back of two motorbikes. It was lashing rain so my driver told me to tuck under his poncho. It was probably for the best that I couldn't see anything. I met a frightened Peter at the airport semi scarred after his first time on a motorbike!</p>
