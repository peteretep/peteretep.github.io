So after the thrill of jumping off a cliff, we got back on the road. Our destination was a small town by the sea called Bahia Inglasia. I wanted to go there because kitesurfing was mentioned in the lonely planet book, but there was no wind and it was cloudy when we got there. We used our new tent and camped wild on the beach that night.

We also went swimming and tested Trish's waterproof camera!

The next day we took a bus to La Serena which got us in at 3 in the morning. After a quick shower in the bus station (one of the best showers I've had down here), we had a nap in the station and checked out the city once it woke up. It was dead because it was Sunday, so after picking up some more camping and dinner supplies in the supermarket we got a bus out to Puclaro Resivoir. Its a great kiting spot with constant wind from September to March; 7m weather every single day! I got the loan of some kit from some of the local guys, and got out for a quick spin.

We couldn't stay longer, and bussed it to Valparaiso the next day. Busy week!
