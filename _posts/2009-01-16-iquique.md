We had a lovely few days in Iquique. Rented some kayaks to see if Olympus' waterproof promises were true or false!

We also got to try some paragliding. Twas savage... Really really enjoyed it. We did a tandem jump off the top of a mountain and landed on the beach, passing the city as we went. I took my camera up with me so managed to get some photos on the way down. I also landed first so got to get a little video of Peter landing.

Peter loved it and is talking of five day courses and the like now... He was also allowed to steer too which brought him back to his distant memory of flying kites... In the mean time my driver decided to do some fancy flying, it was like being in a rollercoaster. No wonder I was sick! Yes, I know how cringey. Apartently it happens lots of people, same sensation as motion sickness. Lets hope I didnt get anyone down below!!
