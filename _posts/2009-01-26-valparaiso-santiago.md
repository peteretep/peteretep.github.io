So so we spent a few days in Valparaíso. Crazy town, with lots of hills to keep us fit! We took it nice and easy here, rented a boat and got some more sailing lessons from peter...

The place also rented yachts to anyone brave enough, wouldn't be allowed back home! It was a good way to see the  town from a far and the mad stacked up houses which look like they've been dropped from the sky.

Theres loads of cool graffitti in the town too so that kept us occupied as we roamed the streets.

There's an old jail which is now dedicated to the art which was pretty cool. <img class="alignnone" title="girl?" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_b1mpf9kDnbA/SXDjlNaM6NI/AAAAAAAAEo0/iOaiFMgIKs8/s512/P1150190.JPG" alt="" width="384" height="512" />

We also attempted to go clubbing but sadly club heuvos (club egg) was closed, we still manged to get to a few local  spots anyway..

We then moved onto Chile's capital with two Canadians we befriended along the way. Santiago was good fun, nice spot to walk about. We also decided to do a spot of gambling.. There's horse racing on fortnightly so that was fairly amusing. We've a feeling its more an activity for the locals as on our arrival we were called into a scary office and we told not to bet too much money!! (Well we think thats what the woman was saying).She also gave us a pile of change (the euros equivalent to 10 cent pieces) which seemed a bit odd....

It's a good thing we got the warning anyway. Won flipping nothing!
