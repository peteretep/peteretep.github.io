today we did the so called "worlds most dangerous road" mountainbike trip. its a popular tour from la paz to corico along a wet, dusty bumpy road through waterfalls and jungle with a 400m drop on one side. I think its a 3000m descent over the 60kms. 
it was savage, mountain biking may be the no wind answer to kitesurfing!
I did the whole thing, and trish did all but the two hardest sections.
We dont have any photos because we were too busy keeping the bikes on the road to take any, but a full cd of photos taken by the guide is on its way to Sligo.

We did the tour with gravity assisted mountain biking, they were the most expensive but also the most recommended. It was pretty clear on the hill that you get what you pay for in terms of equipment and instructors...
