# On finding 'Flow'

Much is written in programmer blogs and sites about 'getting in the zone' or finding 'flow'. I find it hard to get myself settled down to a piece of work, particularly when it's not something I'm interested in or feel falls within my competencies. If I don't want to do it - I struggle.

I'm currently trying to write an assignment that outlines how well Europe is meeting it's greenhouse gas and renewable energy targets. It's a matter of finding and reading documents and figures from various different EU websites. I'm finding it really hard to get my head down to work on this - I haven't been able to find any sort of 'flow'.

In an attempt to get settled down, I'm doing what I used to do when working as a programmer. My earphones are on and some [music with a beat][1] is playing.
My text editor is out, and I'm writing markdown in distraction free mode.

But it's not working. 'Flow' is possible when you know what you're doing, when you know what you need to write. 

Is it possible to find some sort of flow when you have to research what you're doing? Each time I need to check something online the internet calls me away.
And more importantly, is it possible to get into the zone when you really can't care about the task at hand?

If I learn this one thing in this masters, it will all be worth it. But it won't be easy...
