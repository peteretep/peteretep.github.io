Offshore wind farms are becoming a significant business in oceans around
the world. Although many companies are developing floating wind
turbines, to date, most wind turbines are built on foundations on the
seabed. These foundations need to be robust and long lasting. The ocean
is a very inhospitable environment and they need to withstand major
loads applied by wind, waves and sea currents. Offshore wind turbines
typically have a lifespan of 20 years. Offshore wind turbines
are increasing in size, so foundation technology must also progress to
enable these large machines.

There are many factors that influence foundation design but the
geological considerations we will discuss here are:

-   Seabed Bathymetry

-   Seabed soils

-   Sediment movement

Geological Issues
=================

Seabed Bathymetry
-----------------

Depth of the sea is one of the most important considerations for
foundation choice. Some foundations may be impractical or unsuitable for
deeper waters, and sediment movement will occur at different rates
depending on water depth.

The gradient or slope of the seabed is also an issue in offshore wind
farming. Seabeds with a gradient above 5% should be avoided.

Seabed Soils
------------

The seabed is typically covered with a layer of sediment. This sediment
layer is generally thicker near coasts and contains finer grained
particles further from shore. In some areas, there may be little or no
sedimentation due to strong currents. Areas like this are less likely be
used for offshore wind farming due to the difficulty of construction in
this type of environment.

The sediment can consist of calcareous (made from the remains of shells
and skeletons), or siliceous particles. Siliceous sediments contain
hard, round grains, while calcareous sediments are softer and highly
compressible.

The consolidation of sediment is a measure of how much water is in the
sediment. Sediment that has been laid down gradually over time and not
disturbed is referred to as normally consolidated. Water between
sediment particles is gradually removed due to the weight of the
sediment above. Looser, more recent sediment is referred to as under
consolidated.

In some areas, the sediment layer has been compressed by the load of a
glacier. When the glacier melts, the load is removed. The soil is then
referred to as overconsolidated.

The consolidation of the soil will affect itâ€™s load bearing ability.

The sediment present in much of the North Sea - an area with a lot of
offshore wind farms - is overconsolidated and dense, with a recent layer
of softer material. The overconsolidated soils occur because this area was once covered by glaciers.

The choice and specifications of foundations will differ depending on
the consolidation and thickness of sediment layers. Before selecting a
foundation design, it is important to get a three dimensional
understanding of the seabed. Boring and penetration tests are used to
get a sample of the sediment layers. The results are combined with sonar
and bathymetric mapping to build a picture of the site.

Sediment movement
-----------------

The sediment layer on the seabed is constantly changing. Local
hydrodynamic effects and more general sediment migrations will affect
wind turbines in two major ways. Firstly, the changing level of the
seabed will change the effective length of the wind turbine tower. This
will change the natural frequency of the turbine tower and could affect
the rate of fatigue of the materials.

The other issue is the power connection between the turbine tower and
the on-site grid. The connection is typically done using a J-shaped
connector coming out of the foundation. The connector
and electricity cable should be buried in the sediment. If the level of
the seabed falls, this cable could be left hanging in open water where
it is susceptible to damage.

### Scour

Sediment scour is erosion of the seabed around structures. It is an
issue for many installations in marine or river environments.

Scour occurs at the base of a structure where a hole or depression in
the seabed around the structure is formed. It occurs in moving water
when sediment is washed away from around the structure. The level of
scour will depend on the sediment type and the energy in the water.

Whitehouse states that scour is considerable in structures
in sandy areas but not a significant problem for structures placed
directly on a dense clay seabed.

The energy in the water will depend on a number of factors. In an
offshore setting, water movement and therefore scour can be caused both
by tidal currents and wave action. As the movement of water caused by
waves decreases by depth, scour caused by wave action will typically be
less in deeper waters. Dahlberg observed that scour is much
more of an issue in shallower waters.

The presence of the structure in the flow will affect the energy in the
water around the structure. Hydrodynamic calculations will show a water
pressure and velocity differentiation around a structure in a flowing
liquid. Turbulence may be introduced due to the the increased velocity.
The velocity of the water around the structure can increase to higher
than the threshold of sediment motion. When this happens, the sediment
is washed away. According to Shields, the
threshold of sediment motion is proportional to the density and the
diameter of the sediment particles.

### Sand Waves

Sand waves are an overall movement of the seabed. Sand wave crests of up
to 1 metre can move slowly over time. This means the
seabed level can vary over time and this must be taken into account when
designing wind turbine foundations. Areas with significant sand wave
movements may not be suitable for offshore wind farms.

Engineering Solutions
=====================

Choice of foundation type
-------------------------

The two main foundation types used for offshore wind turbines to date
are monopile foundations and gravity foundations.

#### Monopile:

A monopile is a hollow steel tube with a diameter 4m - 8m. It is driven
into the seabed to depths of up to 30m using a piledriver or hydraulic
hammer. A transition section with an access platform is then installed.
This connects the monopile to the turbine tower.

Monopile foundations are the most commonly used foundation and are used
in around 75% of offshore turbines. They are commonly
used where the seabed is hard or semi-hard and in water depths up to 35m.

In conditions as found in the North sea and around UK coasts, monopiles
are driven through the top layer of poorly consolidated soil to the
stiffer over consolidated layers which can support the turbine loads.

If the seabed is hard rock with little sedimentation, it may be
necessary to drill a hole for the monopile. It is then grouted into
place with concrete.

The like many sites in Europe, the London Array wind turbines use
monopile foundations.

Monopiles are relatively economic and simple to install compared to
other foundations and are the most commonly used foundations for this
reason. In deeper waters (30m +), longer pile sections would result in
larger moment forces applied to the foundations. This would require monopiles with thicker
walls to be driven into the seabed to deeper levels. Alternative options
need to be looked at for these deeper waters.

#### Gravity Base Foundations:

Gravity base foundations (GBF) are the second most commonly used
foundation type. They are typically a hollow concrete
cassion which can be filled with rocks and sediment to provide
sufficient ballast to secure the turbine tower.

If a GBF foundation is to be used, the seabed must be levelled and
prepared to support the loads required. The top layer of loose sediment
is removed by dredging. The area is then filled with a number of layers
of crushed rock to give a level and stable base for the foundation. The
foundation is then carefully lowered into place. The sediment removed
previously is then used used to fill the hollow sections of the gravity
base.

GBF foundations were chosen for the Thornton Bank wind farm in Belgian
waters due to the soil conditions at the site. A dense, load
bearing layer of sand was found 28m below the seabed. Less competent
soils were found on top. If a monopile structure was used here, it would
need to extend through the less competent soils to the dense soil below.
The dimensions would need to be very large and this meant a monopile
structure was not economically viable at this site. Instead, the top
layer of sand was dredged to reduce the level by 7m. It was then filled
with a number of layers of gravel to create a load bearing foundation.
Conical GBF were then installed on the site.

#### Other Foundation Types:

Jacket, tripod and suction foundations are options that are being
developed for deeper waters and bigger wind turbines. They have not yet
been deployed at a commercial scale in the wind industry. As the wind
industry moves farther offshore, these foundations will become more
common.

As the main reason to choose these foundation types is the loads on the
tower rather than seabed geological concerns, they will not be discussed
further here.

Scour Protection
----------------

Scour protection is an important consideration in any underwater
construction. Due to hydrodynamic effects, scour depth is typically
greater around structures with a square cross section than cylindrical
structures. Dahlberg studies GBF structures in the north sea.
The Frigg TP1 structure has a square cross section and experiences deep
scour of up to 2m at two corners. The nearby TCP2 structure has a
cylindrical cross section and does not experience the same level of
scour. Cylindrical cross sections are now generally used for both
monopiles and gravity foundations.

#### 

Scour occurs when the energy in the water is higher than the threshold
of sediment motion. According to Shields, the
threshold of sediment motion is proportional to the density and the
diameter of the sediment particles.

The most common way to prevent scour is by layering crushed rock and
gravel around the base of a structure. The larger material will have a
higher threshold of sediment motion and will not get washed away.

There are also scour prevention products on the market which can be
installed around turbine foundations. One such product uses a mat of
recycled car tyres. The voids in the mat fill with seabed material and
the walls of the tyres prevent the material from being washed away.

#### Scour around monopiles:

Monopiles can extend up to 30m into the seabed. In scour prone sites ,
if no protection is added around the pile, a scour hole depth of around
1.5 times the pile diameter is expected. This scour can be accommodated
by the designs - increasing the wall thickness and depth of the pile
penetration will strengthen the foundation. This will increase
the mass and cost of the pile, but this cost may be justified as scour
protection is not needed. The cost benefit analysis of installing scour
protection vs designing for scouring would depend on the specific site.

#### Scour around GBF:

As gravity foundations sit on the seabed and do not extend deeply
through the sediment layers, any level of scour is a major issue. If the
sediment surrounding the foundation is scoured away, the foundation may
move or tilt.

The level of scour around a gravity foundation will depend on the
geometry of the foundation. Both plan and elevation cross sections will
affect the hydrodynamics around the foundation. Tank testing and
computational modelling of the design should be completed to estimate
the level of scour protection required.

Most gravity foundation designs will require some level of scour
protection and these costs must be considered when planning a project.

#### Dealing with scour:

Remedial works can add protection after scouring has occurred by adding
crushed rock layers around the site. This will be significantly more
expensive than installing adequate protection in the construction phase
as it requires hiring vessels.

Conclusion
==========

A detailed exploration of the prospective site is required before
designing a wind turbine foundation. Bathymetry surveys are very
important to discover the basic parameters. Detailed sediment samples
are required to understand the nature of the soils. Once the nature of
the soils has been discovered, the foundation type and level of scour
protection required can be determined.
