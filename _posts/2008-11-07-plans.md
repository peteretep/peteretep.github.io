Ok so the basic plan is to head to south america on the 10th of november and come back four months later on the 10th of march.

thats it.

Well we do have a bit more planned. We're starting in Buenos Aires and flying home from Rio di Janario. We're hoping to visit Uraguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil.
