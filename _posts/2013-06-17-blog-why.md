I've recently helped a few people put together a few WordPress sites - Susan's new business at <a title="Career Ahead" href="http://careerahead.ie">careerahead.ie</a>, my sister Sheila at <a title="Wrap it in words" href="http://wrapitinwords.com">wrapitinwords.com</a> and a site for Franny's boat charter business in Westport at <a href="http://mayoboatcharters.com">mayoboatcharters.com</a>. We also use WordPress for our promotional site at work, <a title="Visual ID" href="http://visualid.com">visualid.com</a>, and recently I've started writing a few articles for the blog. I had forgotten that I enjoyed writing; as a web developer I don't write much in English these days.

When decided it was time to stick up a personal site of my own, WordPress was the obvious choice. As a former fan of mini disc players (I still miss the noise of the discs when you remove them), Peter Lynn Twinskin kites and a current linux user (I had to be right eventually), it's quite unusual for me to go for the obvious choice. The me of a year ago would probably have tried writing a portfolio site from scratch, and would have definitely never finished it. I did toy with the idea of taking a look at the <a href="http://tryghost.org/">ghost</a> project, but I know I wouldn't have gotten around to setting up a node server anytime soon.

So this blog is to dump thoughts and instructions for myself and maybe in future a place to show off some personal projects - if I ever finish any! I've also imported an old blog from a trip around South America to keep it safe for another while.
