<p style="margin-bottom:0;">We stayed two nights in La Paz before going out to Isla Del Sol, an island on Lake Titicaca. It's said to be the birthplace of the sun in Inca mythology. We were disappointed to see the sun setting at 7 o'clock! We were out treking the island with an Israeli girl and boy did it get dark fast. Anyway we got back to the hostel in one piece (after asking nearly every local for directions!. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-97" title="bus ferry" src="http://peteretep.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/img_1423.jpg" alt="bus ferry" width="450" height="300" /></p>
