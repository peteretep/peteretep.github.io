At the start of the summer I decided to do a triathlon.

Although I've spent a lot of my life in or on the water, I hadn't done much sea swimming.
You are required to wear a wetsuit for all triathlons in Ireland, and I knew my 5mm surf suit would be no good for swimming in.
It's a long time since I bought a wetsuit from a shop - when we ran the kitesurfing shop one of our brands sold wetsuits so I typically guessed my size and bought from the catalogue, with mixed results.

I popped into [Call of the Wild][1] in Sligo to get a new swim wetsuit. Eoghan sorted me out with an Orca suit and spent time making sure the fit was perfect. As I paid he mentioned I was entered into a draw to win the price of the suit back.

I was a bit worried when I first started sea swimming but soon got used to it. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I expected and found myself swimming in Salthill multiple times a week.
I swam with Galway Triathlon Club all summer, and did a number of triathlons and aquathons.

I was really happy with my seasons worth of swimming and happy that my suit had been a good investment. Then last week I got a phonecall from Call of the Wild to say I had won the draw to win the price of the wetsuit back!

We're lucky to have such a well stocked outdoor shop in Sligo with staff who really know what they're talking about. You just can't get this service from an online shop. Big thanks to Eoghan and Albert for sorting me out. See you guys back in Sligo for next years swimming season!
