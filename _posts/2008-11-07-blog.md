finally got a blog up and running. after trying for ages to put it up directly on lsdkiteboarding.com, and breaking eamons blog in the process, i've given in and created an account on wordpress.com, and after a quick bit of wikipediaing i figured out how to redirect to it from peter.lsdkiteboarding.com

Great stuff. So hopefully I'll use this blog over the next few months, I'll try to update it with photos and news from different parts of south america. I'm not really the blogging type so hopefully it will be mostly nice photos. I recently bought myself a fancy camera, second hand, and farily cheap. Hopefully it won't get nicked the first day of the trip in Buenos Aires...
