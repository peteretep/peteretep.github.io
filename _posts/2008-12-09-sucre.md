OK Sucre is a fairly big City in Bolivia, it used to be the capital but not anymore.
The main attraction we went to here was the Cretaceous Park - a dinasour museum/theme park. They found loads of dinosaur tracks here in a Quarry about 50 years ago.

It's pretty cool and brought me back to my childhood. Trish on the other hand doubts the existence of the Dinosaurs and thinks the engineers in the quarry put the tracks there as part of a get rich quick scheme!

Also in Sucre we sampled the food available in the market - bunuelos and api for breakfast and tasty stews for dinner. Unfortunately the food hygiene mightn't have been the best and I've been suffering again...

On Sunday night, we were really boring, and all went to the cinema to see the new Bond movie. It turned out to be really educational because most of it was set in Bolivia! The Bolivians in the audience had a great laugh when they saw the corrupt cops on the big screen... Should we be worried?

Tonight we are moving on to La Paz on a 13 hour night bus.
