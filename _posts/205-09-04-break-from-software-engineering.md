Last week I finished up my job as a Ruby on Rails developer at OnePageCRM.
It was a real pleasure working with everybody at OnePageCRM - the development team, product owners and our fantastic customer success team. There is a great bunch of people working there and I will miss them all.

I learned a lot at OnePageCRM, but one of the most important things I will bring away is the 'Get Things Done' methodology that is at the core of the OnePageCRM product.
The 'Next Action' concept can be applied to any project and I hope to continue using this kind of thinking in my life after OnePageCRM.

So, with that in mind, what was my own 'Next Action'?

<ul>
	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>
		First, I raced in my second sprint triathlon. This one included a swim in Salthill, a bike ride out past Barna and a run from Salthill to Galway and back. The weather was perfect and it was all done and dusted by 11am.
	</li>

	<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>
		Then, as my bike was running so well after the triathlon, I decided to take the next two days cycling from Galway to Cork.
	</li>
</ul>


Next, was something a bit more serious.

# Return to University

I'm making a return to university to do a Masters in marine renewable energy engineering.
The course is based in University College Cork, right down the south of Ireland.

It's pretty intimidating to be leaving a good career and returning to studies, but I'm really excited about it.

I have always had a huge interest in the sea and previously tried to make a living as a marine activity provider with my kitesurfing and sailing schools.

I am now hoping to blend my technical experience with my passion for the sea.

Climate change and energy security are two of the most important issues facing the world today. Ireland has huge renewable energy resources offshore but we haven't yet figured out how to exploit them properly.

University College Cork is the centre of excellence in Ireland for marine energy research and development and the imminent opening of the new [Beauford Centre][1] will help to accelerate this.


I'm really looking forward to getting involved in this industry in whatever way I can.
