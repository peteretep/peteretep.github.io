I recently gave part of a talk to UCC Environmental Society about marine renewable energy. Ollie, another student in my class and I spoke about the technology, potential and challenges of marine renewable energy.
The talk was aimed at a broad, non scientific audience, and we tried to make it as interesting and as inclusive as possible. The audience was great and asked lots of interesting questions.


Here are the slides we used:
