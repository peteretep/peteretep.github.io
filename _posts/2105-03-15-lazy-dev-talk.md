title: Lazy Developer Website Talk
category: tech
excerpt: I recently gave a short talk for Galway's 091Labs hackerspace on creating a quick and not so dirty website using Github Pages. It's pretty basic stuff but I enjoyed giving the talk. You can find the presentation at http://peterarmstrong.ie/lazy-developer-website/
