So it has been a while since we have been online; we have been real busy travelling across the north of argentina.

From Montivideo in Uruguay, we travelled north to Salta on an overnight bus, arriving in Salto at 5 in the morning. We read about some thermal springs in the Salto region in our lonely planet, and as we were waiting for an evening bus on the 18th. So we got on the first bus that said "termas" and thought we were going 8km down the road to the nearest baths. Instead we were no the bus for an hour and a half travelling through Uruguayan cowboy country. We ended up in a resort village with hotels and stuff all around. There was a few swimming pools around and after trying to figure out who to pay or what the story was, we got into the busiest one, which was filled with nice warm thermal water, and loads of scary old people...

We lasted about 30mins and got the next bus out of there, the bus driver was having a great laugh at us..

So that afternoon we crossed the border back into Argentina, and then got onto another night bus (12 hours!) up to Pureto Iguazu, right up the north east of Argentina.

There's these amazing waterfalls there, really impressive stuff. The waterfalls are in a wildlife reserve and they have loads of monkeys and other little animals just roaming around the park.

So the falls were amazing and the photos can't really show the full extent of them, its a huge park and there is just water falling everywhere! The funny thing is, unlike visiting glencar, it doesn't rain!

Puerto Iguazu was a really popular touristy spot and it was strange being back on the "backpacker trail".

From there, we took a bus to Posados, a town down the road. By down the road I mean 6 hours on a local minibus! Once in Posados, we made the mistake of trying to go further, hoping to get a night bus from the next big town over. So we got on another bus (a nice comfortable coach this time, with dinner, dvd's and they even offered us whiskey!) for another 4hour ride to Corrientes. We got into Corrientes at around half 11 at night, and the plan was to get on a night bus to Tucaman, to save on accomodation. Unfortunately, the next bus  wasn't until six the next morning, so we went across the road for some pizza and a litre of cheap red wine, with the plan to stay in the bus station for the night. When we got back to the station, we were told that the morning bus was full, the next one being at 5 the next afternoon. So we had to book into a hotel in Corrientes for the night, a city that is mentioned in the guide book for having no nice accomodation. Boy were they right!

Anyway, another 13hr night bus, and by now we are installed in a nice hostel in Tucaman. The town is just recovering from a big match between the Buenos Aires team and the local guys, so it's quiet at the moment, but it looks like a nice town and there are a good few activities to do around the area that we might check out tomorrow.
