Hello hello.. Sorry for lack of blogging but the auld wee fee was hard to come by for a while... So after Tucuman we went higher to Tafi De Valle to some cooler temperatures. We both ended up being sick at the same time so recovered a little and move onwards and upwards to Cafayte. Spent a few more days there. Rented some bicycles but found the sandy tracks very tricky to cycle on...

Once recovered we went to Salta. A nice laid back city with some great icecreams! We drove the poor man in the hostel mad requesting parapante!!? (paragliding) but sadly one day was too cloudy and the next too windy. Oh well hopefully in Peru...

After Salta we dipped into Chile. Stayed two nights in San Pedro. We had got the tip off from a lovely swedish couple to do a star gazing tour in the middle of the dessert. (thanks amelie&amp;jacob!).

 The next day we moved on to Bolivia. TBC!
