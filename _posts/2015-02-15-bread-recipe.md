title: Bread Dough Recipe

We held a cake sale in OnePageCRM last week to raise money for our [MS Ireland's Galway's Fittest Workplace](1) team.
The whole office got behind the idea and a huge variety of cakes and bakes were produced.
I don't know how to bake any cakes or anything sweet, so I voulenteered to make bread for sandwiches.

I generally use the same recipe for bread and pizza dough - it's super simple and nearly always works out ok for me.
I'm always being asked the recipe, so here it is:

  * Warm water, not too hot - 1 cup
  * 1 sachet of dried yeast. You can get this in most supermarkets
  * Odlums Strong White Flour - 3 cups
  * Olive oil - a good glug
  * Honey
  * Salt

The flour is important - Strong White Flour is what you need when baking with yeast.

I mix the water and yeast together, along with the olive oil, honey and salt. The water should be warm to encourage the yeast to grow, but not I add the honey to give the dough a slightly sweet taste, and it also helps the dough to rise as the yeast likes the sugar in the honey.
Leave it for a few minutes in a warm place until the mix starts to look disgusting. That means the yeast is working.
Then add in the other two cups of flour and mix it all up.
Then comes the kneading - knead for as long as you can be bothered.

That's pretty much it - the only other thing you need to add is time.

If you're making bread, put the dough into your bread tins. It's good to grease the tins with olive oil first.

**Make sure you don't fill the tins too much, as your dough is going to expand, a lot!**

Bake for around 30mins in an oven that's around 190ÂºC. As I grew up cooking with an Aga, I never know exact temperatures or times. Basically the bread should sound hollow when you tap it.

Turn the loaves out onto a tray. As my mother always says, make sure you let them cool before eating, or you'll get a sick tummy!

Try to avoid eating the whole loaf in one sitting with a slab of butter and a pot of jam!


### Pizza

I use the exact same dough recipe to make pizzas. Instead of putting the dough into tins, I leave the whole lot to rise in a big bowl, well covered with olive oil and covered with cling film. Sometimes I give it a second knead to knock it back and let it rise again, but I'm not convinced it's necessary.
