¡Hola! We are now in Colonia de Sacremento. It´s a lovely little town just across the river estuary from Buenos Aires. It´s a nice change from BA, its a small town that´s very touristy. Everyone here rides scooters and you can rent them all over the place, but they wanted motorbike liscences so we couldn´t get one! Gutted!

No photos at the moment but will post some more soon. My camera isnt talking to my computer so I need to figure that out first.

laters...
