I spotted <a href="http://iqcontent.com/people/careers/lead-web-developer/">this</a> job posting from iQ Content and thought it was interesting because it asks candidates to do a few "coding challenges" to go with their application. Their choices of projects is interesting and highlights the importance of being able to work with API's, mobile, and of course that most current of web design buzz words "Responsive Design".

Although I'm not looking for a job at the moment, I'm saving these projects here for myself to look at later.

1. Tweatmap
Create an application which generates a real-time heatmap of the most recent 1000 Irish tweets on a google map.

2. Responsive Onion
Create a responsive design prototype of theonion.com homepage. It should work on a multitude of screens, including desktop, tablet and mobile. Feel free to change the HTML as appropriate, however the desktop version should look identical to the current desktop version.

3. TrainAPI
Using the Irish Rail API (http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/index.htm). Create a mobile application (native or HTML5) which lists the next 10 train times of nearby stations.
