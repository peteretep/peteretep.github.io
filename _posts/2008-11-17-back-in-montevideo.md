Two days later and back in Montevideo! We went on a little summer holiday out to Piriápolis. Its a real seaside town. Stayed in a cute little cabin. The guy who owned the place mumbled to Peter how fine the Irish whiskey is! As its just spring here the place was a little bit quiet but it was a good break and nice to see the sea...

Montevideo was much more livelier today and the strong gales were gone... We're taking our first night bus tonight. Heading north to Salto and then onwards and upwards towards the Iguazú Falls. Unfortunately my tummy wont let me read on the bus but thankfully it does let me sleep! Peter on the other hand is finding it much harder to sleep on the public transport...

Looking forward to getting on the road properly. Hope it isn't too chilly at home x

In the bus station so we dont have the chance to update the photos yet..
