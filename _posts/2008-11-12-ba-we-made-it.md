Flew to Atlanta and then down. When we reached Buenos Aires yesterday morning we received the good news that our m√°las headed off on their own little adventure to Chile. Imbeciles! Anyhoo when we got back to the hostel last night they had been delivered to our rooms. yeay!

We're only two hours behind so we weren't too affected with the jet lag. Its been lovely and sunny here and typically I got the shoulders a little burned today....We also got nice and lost today too but I suppose that's part of the adventure....

Went exploring La Boca today. Built by the Italians, it has lots of colourful corrugated metal buildings.<a href="http://peterarmstrong.ie/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pb121695.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15" title="trish in la boca" src="http://peterarmstrong.ie/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/pb121695.jpg" alt="trish in la boca" width="450" height="337" /></a>

We also mastered the city buses today. (I let Peter go first and he opened the money machine by accident, thankfully there was an Argentinian close by to teach him some manners!)

Dunno if we've anything else to report. Will try attaching some photos, thres some more over on the right on flickr - just click them
