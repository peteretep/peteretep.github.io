We skipped the border from Chile to Argentina on Tuesday to a city called Mendoza. It's in the main wine producing region in Argentina and wine is a bit of a big deal. We got a bit of a shock as things were more expensive here than in north Argentina at the start of our trip. The place was also mobbed and for the first time we had difficulty getting a place to stay.
We went on a wine tour on Wednesday and got to see a few different winereys, as well as a museum of wine, showing how it was made through the years. The format of the tour was a little different, we rented bikes and got to cycle around to different vinyards all day.

We also stopped at a little chocolate/liquer/jam factory and got to taste the produce. As it happened, it was also one of the hottest days on record in Mendoza, 36 degrees! We also both got new haircuts, classic south american mullets all round!

The heat really didn't suit us so we didn't get up to much else, and took the long bus trip south to Bariloche on Friday.

We arrived to Bailoche on Saturday afternoon in shorts and t-shirts, and were shocked by the icy winds and rain coming from the mountains. Bailoche is a ski town in winter, and everyone had their cold weather gear on, except us. We found a nice campsite, pitched the tent and then went to the local Irish bar- "Wilkenny", apparently the best spot in town! It was just like home - overpriced and jamed, the only difference was they dont have the smoking ban!

This morning the weather was much better, and we're going to try to do some rafting tomorrow.
