title: Ireland to Japan Overland
---

For the last few weeks, I've been travelling overland from Ireland to Japan, by train, boat and bus.
For my own reasons, I decided not to write any blog posts about the trip.
It's been a great trip and I've finally reached Japan.
I have a few days left here and then I fly back to Ireland.
After taking five weeks to get here, it will feel really strange to cover the whole distance back in two short days.
To anyone considering a trip on the Trans-Siberian railway all I can say is just go for it.
