# What's the problem?
* Our front end is becoming more complex
    - Heavy use of Ajax 
* The code behind it is a mess
* We are all afraid of javascript
* JQuery isn't good enough for our new requirements

# Why react?
* Easy to add to the project in small chunks
* Well supported
* Good rails integration - react-rails gem
* Hip new technology!

# How to do it?

* Demo - print a test component - Hello World!
* Creating a class
* React.render( what, where )

* What is a component
* Components vs Elements

# New architecture

## Nodejs - what is it?

## Browserify - John

* Installation - gem
* Installing node packages
* Requiring with browserify
* Advantages of browserify

## Folder Structure

* Components are self contained 

`app/assets/javascripts/flux`

* Each top level component has a folder for itself
    - eg. import_export/history_list contains all the components

* Utils folder contains reusable API stuff
