Anyone who has ever visited a beach along the exposed west coast of Ireland should realise there is a lot of energy in the waves crashing ashore.
As a small island nation in the north atlantic, we have some of the best wave resources in the world. But a resource isn't much use if you can't use it - and to date the only people who use our waves are the huge number of surfers who hit the beaches on the west coast regularly.

## Electrical Power from Waves

Engineers have been trying to extract the power from waves for years, but to date there are no commercially available wave energy convertion devices.
There are loads of companies working in this area hoping to be the first to crack the many problems.

So, if people have been working on the problem for over 15 years, and still haven't cracked it, why should we still be investing and working on this?

Let's take a step back to see why people think it's a problem worth solving.

## How much energy is in a wave?

The amount of energy in a wave can be calculated using some maths. (I'd love to say 'simple' maths, but I'm still struggling with it myself). Let's take a look at the simplest case, and see if we can figure out how much energy would be available in 1 meter of typical Irish coastline.
