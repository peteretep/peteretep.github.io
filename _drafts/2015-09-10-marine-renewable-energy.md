## Marine Renewable Energy - Week 1

Last Monday I started a masters in Marine Renewable Energy. I'm planning to write a bit about the course and what I'm learning as the year goes on.
I won't be writing about anything new, unique or anything that can't be found elsewhere, better explained and in more detail.
My reasons for writing are twofold:

* I enjoy writing
* To help me summarize the topics I'm learning
* To encourage me to revise the lectures

So far, I've had four different classes:

* Power Electronics and Drives
* Sustainable Energy
* Wind Energy
* Energy Systems Modelling

I've also met a number of students who took the course last year. They presented a number of interesting research topics they had been working on for the last few months. It was a great way to get flavour of the type of project I would be expected to present this time next year.
